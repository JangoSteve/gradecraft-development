  %h3 Using Gradecraft

%p.small-12.columns Our intent is to create a tool that makes it easy for anyone to create a gameful course assessment system. We're piloting a new and more generalizable version of GradeCraft during the fall semester of 2013, and our hope is that we can make it available for anyone to use by January 2013.
