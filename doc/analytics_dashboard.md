# Analytics Dashboard

When logged in as a staff member, visit the `/analytics` page in the
browser.

The displayed charts can be interacted with in several ways.

## Range and Granularity

To change the displayed time range, select a different range from the
Range dropdown. By keeping the Granularity dropdown set to "Auto", the
granularity will automatically be determined by the selected range. E.g.
"Past Year" will show monthly granularity, "Past Month" will show
weekly granularity, and so on.

Once the desired Range and Granularity are selected, click the "Refresh"
button.

## Displayed Series

When multiple series are displayed in a chart, a legend is shown
indicating the name of each series. Click a series to show only that
series (and hide all others). Once a series is shown, other series may
be shown along with it (while all others remain hidden), by holding down
shift, ctr, or cmd, and clicking the other desired series.
